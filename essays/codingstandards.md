## Introduction

This week in ICS 314 we have started our journey towards achieving competency in our class software stack in ernest. In the IDE and Quality Assurance modues we were required to install, configure, and become familiar with using the [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) IDE for development, along with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for quality assurance. 

## ESLint

I have mixed feelings towards ESLint. Having a class coding standard in place makes it significantly easier to read each others code.
