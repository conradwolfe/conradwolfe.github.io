&emsp;&emsp;When I decided that I wanted to go into Software Engineering it was in no small part due to my interest in Game Development. I have been playing video games for as long as I can remember, and the idea of learning to develop them really caught my interest. From there, after enrolling in my first Computer Science course I discovered my love for coding and also became interested in Artificial Intelligence, and Cyber Security. 

### The Future
&emsp;&emsp;In the future I would like to learn more about my Software Engineering related interests and develop my skillset so that I am able to realistically pursue a career in those fields. In order to achieve this, I recently joined the University of Hawaii chapter of the Association of Computer Machinery. I hope to use my time there in order to gain experience with Game Development and Cyber Security, as well as creating projects that are worthy of adding to my Professional Portfolio. I also am hoping to get the chance to take courses related to Game Development, Cyber Security, and Artificial Intelligence that are offered at UH Manoa. After graduation I currently plan on looking for job opportunities, but I am also considering pursing a Masters Degree in Computer Science after gaining some job experience.
