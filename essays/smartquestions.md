## Intro

“There’s no such thing as a dumb question”, I’m sure that everyone has heard that saying at some point in their lives. But is it true? After reading [How to Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#bespecific) by Eric Steven Raymond, I am of the opinion that they do exist, and things can get pretty ugly. But there are two sides to every coin. Having dumb questions means that we have smart questions too, and that’s something that I can get behind. 

## Why does it matter?

As Software Engineers we are tasked with coming up with new and innovative solutions to difficult problems on a day to day basis, and if you’re anything like me technical forums like Stack Overflow are your best friend. But these forums won’t always have the answers you’re looking for, and when that happens, being able to ask a smart question can really save the day. Smart questions enable you to quickly gather the information you need, by making it easier for others to help you. But, before you start asking others for help, do your due diligence and make a serious attempt to find the answer yourself. Being able to Google effectively so that you can be certain that you’re conducting high quality preliminary research is crucial. You don’t want to be that person who posts a question that can be answered with a quick Google search. If you end up determining that you have no choice but to seek out help, make sure the question you ask is a smart one. Be specific about what information you’re looking for, include what research you’ve already done, and mention if there’s something that you didn’t understand. When it comes to questions on technical forums you’re going to get out, what you put in. If you put a lot of effort into asking a smart question it will show, and you’re much more likely to receive a high-quality response in a timely fashion. The opposite is also true, dumb questions will often receive negative and non-constructive responses. 

## Examples plox

Example of an [good question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/477816/what-is-the-correct-json-content-type).
This question clearly states what it is the asker is looking for, shows that they have some understanding of the subject, and that they have done preliminary research before asking. As a result it has an absolutely masive amount of upvotes, as well as having recieved a quality answer within minutes of the question being asked, it's also worth noting that the answer was also massively upvoted..

Example of a [bad question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20574925/c-file-homework).
Another [bad question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54319362/how-to-read-xml-file-and-how-do-i-append-a-node-inside-xml-tag-file-in-java) these questions are bad because they show that littel to no preliminary research was done, and come across as "plz do my work for me"

While perusing StackOverflow and doing some researching for this essay I found a bad question about bad questions that was severely downvoted.
