Example of an [good question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/477816/what-is-the-correct-json-content-type).
This question clearly states what it is the asker is looking for, shows that they have some understanding of the subject, and that they have done preliminary research before asking. As a result it has an absolutely masive amount of upvotes, as well as having recieved a quality answer within minutes of the question being asked, it's also worth noting that the answer was also massively upvoted..

Example of a [bad question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20574925/c-file-homework).
Another [bad question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54319362/how-to-read-xml-file-and-how-do-i-append-a-node-inside-xml-tag-file-in-java) these questions are bad because they show that littel to no preliminary research was done, and come across as "plz do my work for me"

While perusing StackOverflow and doing some researching for this essay I found a bad question about bad questions that was severely downvoted. 
Irony found [here](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225739/stack-overflow-has-gotten-mean)
