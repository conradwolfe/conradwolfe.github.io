## A Brief Summary

For ICS 314 - Software Engineering I, my group developed a web application for our final project that utilized a calendar and Mongo DB collections in order to allow students to schedule study sessions with one another. If a student has already taken a course, they also have the option to tutor a session for that course. Students are then raked on a leaderboard by their accumulated experience, which is rewarded upon completing a session with ‘rewards’ being offered for the top earners.

My contribution to this project was to assist in the development of the landing page, leaderboard, navigation bar, and admin page, as well as helping to develop MongoDB collections that would store the app’s data. The most difficult technical aspect of the project for me was correctly implementing Meteor’s user collection which was the source of many of the issues that we encountered during development. On the other hand, working with the collections that we created proved to be one of the most enjoyable parts of the project, and I enjoyed the opportunity to get some hands-on experience with how information is moved and manipulated in a more complex application.

## Lessons Learned

The biggest takeaway from this project was the experience of working with a team in order to develop an application and getting to see the positives and negatives that come along with it. Making sure that all group members were on the same page and working towards the same goal did prove to be challenging at times. However, at the end of the day working as a team was an incredibly enjoyable experience and I feel like we managed to create something pretty cool together. I am truly appreciative that I got to work with this group of people, and of the time and effort that they invested in order to bringing this project to life.
