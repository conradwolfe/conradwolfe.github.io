## Description

As an assignment for ICS 211 - Intro to Computer Science II, I was tasked with using Java to create a GUI application that allows a user to view, edit, and export data from a queue to/from a .txt file. 

## Lessons Learned

This assignment gave me the chance to practice using JPanes in order to implement a GUI to create an interactive experience outside of the console. I also got to work with a queue and see the flow of data, which was helpful in understanding how the data structure works on a more fundamental level.

## Skills Acquired

This assignment gave me experience using Java to perform File i/o, work with queues, and implement a driver and GUI
